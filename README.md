# Backtracking Algorithm for Assigning Courses

## Overview

This project focuses on implementing a backtracking algorithm in Java to solve the problem of assigning courses to different days. The goal is to minimize the number of students affected by having two courses on the same day.

## Features

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: The core of the project is a backtracking algorithm that explores different combinations of course assignments to find the one that minimizes the number of affected students.

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The project uses object-oriented principles to model the problem domain. The `Assignatura` class represents a course, and the `SolucioCalendari` class represents a potential solution to the problem.

- **Unit Testing**: The project includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the algorithm and the associated classes.

## Project Details

- **Language**: Java
- **Objective**: To implement a backtracking algorithm that assigns courses to days in a way that minimizes the number of students affected by having two courses on the same day.
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Projects will be evaluated based on the correctness of the algorithm, the design of the classes, and the thoroughness of the unit tests.
